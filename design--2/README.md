# Meet

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my meet project. It's a small front-end project I worked on as part of my learning journey.

## What is meet?

Meet makes it easy to connect with others face-to-face virtually and collaborate across any device

## How to Check it Out

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Clipboard-Landing-Page.git

2. Open index.html in your browser.

Happy coding! ðŸ”¥
