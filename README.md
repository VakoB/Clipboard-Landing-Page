# Clipboard Landing Page

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Clipboard Landing Page project. It's a small front-end project I worked on as part of my learning journey.

## What is Clipboard?

Clipboard is a cool web app that helps you keep track of everything you copy. This landing page is designed to show off its features in a simple and visually appealing way.

## How to Check it Out

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Clipboard-Landing-Page.git

2. Open index.html in your browser.

Feel free to explore. Happy coding! ðŸš€
